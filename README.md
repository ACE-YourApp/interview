## Instructions
Need to create a small application - a library of books.

### Screens
 - List of books
 - Add a new book
 - Edit/Delete book

It is necessary to do without client-server interaction, you can use SQLite or Shared Preferences as a storage, while keeping in mind that in the future all actions (adding books, editing, etc.) will work through the server, i.e. you need to make it possible to easily change the data source.

Also need to add unit tests.

#### Example how it should look
